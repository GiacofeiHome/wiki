## Description
Turning off the solenoids after an FZ test causes the SuperFlow board to reset.

## TODO

  - [ ] Find plug end of loose wire on dyno #2 relay board.
  - [ ] Check Dyno #1 harness for failure (does it trip the superflow board?)
    - [ ] Need to move harness chip from dyno #2 to dyno #1
      - [ ] Wire connectors??
    - [ ] Swap the wire harness from dyno #1 to dyno #2
