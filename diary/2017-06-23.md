## FZ Dyno Harness Chip Wiring
:REVIEW-2017:FZ:MAINTENANCE:
Added terminal connectors to the harnes chip on Dyno #2. In the process discovered that the chip
wires for dyno one were connected to the wrong pins.

After switching the incorrect wires a solenoid test can be succesfully run on Dyno #1 with no
issues.

Next steps for this project will be to map out the wiring harness on Dyno #1.
