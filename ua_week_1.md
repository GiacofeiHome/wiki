*Why do people want reasons for their beliefs and decisions?* [Post](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-arguments/discussions/all/threads/K4SmE4-3 )

    Having good reasons is important for arriving at good conclusions.
    Without reason we're relying entirely on our pre-existing dogma and biases without
    consideration that we may be wrong.

    Thinking about the reasons for what we believe helps us to uncover areas of ignorance 
    or bias we may not even realize were there.
